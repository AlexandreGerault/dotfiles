# Alexandre Gerault - dotfiles

This is my personnal dotfiles repository. It is mainly used in a saving purpose but feel free to use whatever you want.

## Installation

**CAUTION** Before installing these dotfiles, be sure to save yours if you made any change. The installation script is made to be idempotent so it deletes the existing configuration files.

To use these dotfiles, you have to :
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:AlexandreGerault/dotfiles.git
```
2. Make the install script executable
```
chmod +x dotfiles/install
```
3. Execute the install script:
```
./dotfiles/install
```
